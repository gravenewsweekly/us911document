            <div class="classified-banner">OFFICIAL USE ONLY - UNCLASSIFIED</div>
            <p>The September 11 attacks (also known as 9/11) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the militant Islamist terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks resulted in 2,977 fatalities, over 25,000 injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Key Facts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Date:</strong> September 11, 2001</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> New York City; Arlington County, Virginia; near Shanksville, Pennsylvania</li>
                    <li><strong>Attack type:</strong> Aircraft hijacking, mass murder, suicide attacks, terrorism</li>
                    <li><strong>Perpetrators:</strong> Al-Qaeda (led by Osama bin Laden)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>The attacks involved the hijacking of four commercial airliners. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both towers collapsed. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was initially flown toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers attempted to regain control from the hijackers.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-search"></i> Root Causes and Reasons Behind the Attacks</h2>
            <p>The 9/11 attacks were the culmination of years of planning by al-Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden. The motivations behind the attacks were complex and rooted in a combination of religious extremism, political grievances, and ideological opposition to U.S. foreign policy.</p>
            
            <h3>Primary Motivations:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>U.S. Military Presence in Saudi Arabia:</strong>
                    <p>Bin Laden cited the permanent stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia (home to Islam's two holiest sites) following the Gulf War as a primary grievance. He viewed this as a desecration of holy land and an occupation by infidels.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Support for Israel:</strong>
                    <p>Al-Qaeda opposed U.S. support for Israel in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, viewing it as oppression of Muslims.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sanctions Against Iraq:</strong>
                    <p>The group opposed U.S.-led sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s, which they claimed caused widespread suffering among Iraqi civilians.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Globalization and Western Cultural Influence:</strong>
                    <p>Bin Laden sought to resist what he saw as corrupting Western influence in Muslim countries and the erosion of traditional Islamic values.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Desire to Provoke U.S. Military Response:</strong>
                    <p>Some analysts believe bin Laden hoped to provoke a massive U.S. military response that would rally Muslims worldwide against the West.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>The attacks had profound immediate and long-term consequences for the United States and the world:</p>
            
            <h3>Immediate Response:</h3>

                <li>Massive emergency response and recovery operations in New York</li>
                <li>Evacuation of high-profile buildings nationwide</li>
                <li>Closure of U.S. stock markets until September 17 (longest closure since 1933)</li>

                <li>Later invasion of Iraq (2003), partially justified by claimed (but unsubstantiated) links to al-Qaeda</li>
                <li>Global War on Terror declared by President George W. Bush</li>

The New York City economy suffered tremendously, with an estimated $60 billion in damages to infrastructure and $17 billion in lost economic activity in the first four weeks alone. The airline industry was particularly hard hit, with passenger numbers dropping sharply and several major airlines filing for bankruptcy.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> Osama bin Laden and His Demise</h2>
            <p>Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (March 10, 1957 - May 2, 2011) was the founder of al-Qaeda, the organization that claimed responsibility for the September 11 attacks along with numerous other mass-casualty attacks worldwide.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Osama bin Laden Profile:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Born:</strong> March 10, 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</li>
                    <li><strong>Died:</strong> May 2, 2011 (aged 54) in Abbottabad, Pakistan</li>
                    <li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Saudi (revoked in 1994), Stateless thereafter</li>
                    <li><strong>Known for:</strong> Founding al-Qaeda, masterminding 9/11 attacks</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Manhunt and Death:</h3>
            <p>Following the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden became the most wanted man in the world, with the U.S. offering a $25 million bounty for information leading to his capture. After evading capture for nearly a decade, U.S. intelligence located him living in a secure compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.</p>
            
            <p>On May 2, 2011, U.S. Navy SEALs from SEAL Team Six conducted a covert operation (code-named Operation Neptune Spear) that resulted in bin Laden's death. The operation, authorized by President Barack Obama, took approximately 40 minutes. Bin Laden was shot twice (once in the chest and once above the left eye) during the assault. His body was taken to Afghanistan for identification, then buried at sea within 24 hours in accordance with Islamic tradition.</p>
            
            <h3>Aftermath of bin Laden's Death:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirmed weakening of al-Qaeda's central leadership</li>
                <li>Increased drone strikes against remaining al-Qaeda leadership</li>
                <li>Strain in U.S.-Pakistan relations due to bin Laden's presence in Pakistan</li>
                <li>DNA testing confirmed bin Laden's identity with 99.9% certainty</li>
            </ul>
